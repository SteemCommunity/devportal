The library was designed to allow Python developers to easily access the network as well as build utilities and applications.

Currently steem-python documentation is generated in the standard [pydoc format](https://steem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Documentation is available at: [Official steem-python Docs](https://github.com/steemit/steem-python).

In our Python tutorials we recommend developers to be familiar with following requirements/libraries.


* Python developer should be familiar with Python 3.x and above

* Medium knowledge of package manager `pip/pip3` and/or `pipenv` is required, since our tutorials will be using package manager to get started quickly.

* Terminal (Linux/Mac) or Cmd (Windows command prompt) knowledge is also required, since most python tutorials will only work with terminal and print out result in different formats. 

* Python environment path should be set up properly so that terminal can access proper python library without conflicts.

* Additional and optional packages that we might use: setuptools, brew
